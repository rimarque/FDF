# **FdF**

## :speech_balloon: **About**
Fdf is a computer graphics project that uses  the school graphics library, MiniLibX,  to represent a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines. 
The program reads a file that contains the coordinates of the landscape and uses an algorithm to connect the dots with lines, representing it in isometric projection.
The project is coded in C, utilizing the mlx library.

## :link: **Compilation**
To compile the program you should run `make`.

This rule will generate an executable file named `fdf`. To launch the executable you should follow this syntax:

```sh
$ ./fdf/maps/42.fdf
```
Or, if you have your own maps you want to render:

```sh
$ ./fdf ./path_to_map/map_name.rt
```
